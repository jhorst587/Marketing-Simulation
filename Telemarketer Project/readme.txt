This project contains a few models of telemarketing firms. In the base model, Telemarketer.nlogo, each patch represents a potential customer. A given number of telemarketing businesses will be created at random locations in the model upon setup. At the start of the simulation, all telemarketing firms have a size of 1. As the firm grows, its size will increase proportional to the money-size-ratio and it will appear as a larger circle. During each tick, all patches start as green, which represents a customer that has not been called yet. The first time a customer is called, that customer always makes a purchase and becomes red. Customers represented by red patches never make purchases. Each tick, every telemarketing business calls a number of customers equal to ten times the square root of its size. If the number of potential customers is less than the maximum amount of calls that can be made, the business calls all potential customers. After making calls, each telemarketing business must pay expenses equal to fifty times its size. If a business has below zero for its bank-balance, it will be deleted from the simulation. Any business that has excess income will expand proportionally to the money-size-ratio. After 200 ticks, the simulation ends. 

Telemarketer_new_businesses.nlogo uses Telemarketer.nlogo as a base, but new telemarketing businesses are created when the total size of the turtles is less than a specified size-threshold. This is to represent new opportunities in the market that are created when larger businesses fail and some customers are not buying products. Another reason these changes were made is to create a simulation that can run indefinitely because the original simulation would inevitably result in only one telemarketing business remaining if left to run for enough time.
