This project contains two different models of telemarketing firms which simulate sales to customers and the ability of businesses to survive among competitors. In each model, businesses make calls to customers which always buy a product if they have not yet bought a product yet in the current tick. Each business will then grow in proportion to the number of sales it has made this tick. This model shows the importance of reaching customers before competitors. Since each business makes all of its sales calls at once and only one business makes calls at a time, businesses in areas with many competitors will have very few customers that are willing to buy product and will likely fail. The second version of the model, Telemarketer_new_businesses.nlogo can be used to examine what happens when new businesses are added to the equation. In this version of the model, new businesses are created when others fail and new opportunities are created in the market. This model could potentially be modified to represent businesses in industries other than telemarketing or change the practices of the businesses to resemble different growth models.

To run this simulation, download the desired model version and go to https://netlogoweb.org/launch. On the top right of the screen, click choose file and upload the desired .nlogo file. Once the file is uploaded, click the setup button and then the run button to start the simulation. 

In the base model, Telemarketer.nlogo, each patch represents a potential customer. A given number of telemarketing businesses will be created at random locations in the model upon setup. At the start of the simulation, all telemarketing firms have a size of 1. As the firm grows, its size will increase proportional to the money-size-ratio and it will appear as a larger circle. During each tick, all patches start as green, which represents a customer that has not been called yet. The first time a customer is called, that customer always makes a purchase and becomes red. Customers represented by red patches never make purchases. Each tick, every telemarketing business calls a number of customers equal to ten times the square root of its size. If the number of potential customers is less than the maximum amount of calls that can be made, the business calls all potential customers. After making calls, each telemarketing business must pay expenses equal to fifty times its size. If a business has below zero for its bank-balance, it fails and will be removed from the simulation. Any business that has excess income will expand proportionally to the money-size-ratio. After 200 ticks, the simulation ends. 

Telemarketer_new_businesses.nlogo uses Telemarketer.nlogo as a base, but new telemarketing businesses are created when the total size of all busenesses is less than a specified size-threshold. This is to represent new opportunities in the market that are created when larger businesses fail and demand is created for more products. Another reason these changes were made is to create a simulation that can run indefinitely because the original simulation inevitably results in only one telemarketing business remaining if left to run for enough time.
